Lazy Delivery Network
=====================

One-file applicate made for lazy developers. Now you can put all your JavaScript and CSS files in one place and have them accessible locally from one place.

Yes, I know about tools like bower, but when I'm not using them for now I better like this solution :P

How to use
----------
 1. Clone repository to web accessible diretory
 2. Put your **JavaScript** files in ```./js``` subdirectory
 3. Put your **CSS** files in ```./css``` subdirectory
 4. Enjoy your LDN site ;)
